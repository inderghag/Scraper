# Scraper
Searches product info from Bestbuy and Amazon of item entered in terminal.

Creates a json file with all scraped items from the first pages of the two sites.
'parsedata.py' can be edited to sort through the items as needed, currently only
returns number of items in the json file. Running the scraper multiple times appends
to the json file instead of rewriting it.
